# Hi, I'm Bryan David 👋

**Recent CS grad • From Oaxaca, lived in the US, now in Mexico City • Building simple, useful things**

I believe the best technology feels invisible. *It just works.* I'm passionate about creating software that's not just functional, but genuinely easy and enjoyable to use. Simplicity is way harder than it looks, and that's exactly the kind of challenge I love solving.

## 🚀 What I'm focused on

- **Building for real users**: Currently maintaining my personal website ([david.computer](https://david.computer)) built from scratch with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Sharpening my skills**: Daily LeetCode practice (60+ days and counting), strengthening my data structures and algorithms foundation
- **Seeking opportunities**: Searching for my first software engineering role where I can build things people actually *want* to use
## 🛠️ My toolkit

```
Languages:     Python • Java • JavaScript • HTML/CSS • SQL • C++  
Tools:         Git • VS Code • Eclipse
Currently:     Diving deeper into full-stack development & user-centered design
```

## 🌟 A bit about my journey

🎓 **Computer Science degree** from New Mexico State University (Dec 2024)  
🌎 **Bilingual** – Native Spanish, fluent English (born & raised in Oaxaca → 7 years in the US → back home in Mexico)  
💼 **Real-world experience** – Worked part-time through university, including managing teams  
🎯 **Design-minded** – I actually enjoy thinking about wireframes and user flows  

## 💡 What drives me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior. Why do some apps feel effortless while others make you want to throw your phone? How can we build things that are powerful but never overwhelming? These are the questions that get me excited about coding.

Whether it's a sleek web interface or a thoughtful mobile experience, I want to create software that makes people's lives a little bit easier.
